Question 2:
You are developing an automated Youtube Script generator that integrates a fine-tuned LLM API, and it will be:
· Used by our internal team of 10 or so content creators to expedite their script and Youtube thumbnail / asset generation
· Subsequently (6m+) offered as a SaaS application
Come up with a brief plan for building this, including the tech stack and approach to scalability.


Answer.

The automated youtube script generator is an innovative saas solution designed to streamline content creation of youtube for
internal teams and eventual expansion.
Here is complete architectural approach to build a robust system for script generation.

Key Approach:
The system will be built on a robust microservice architecture that will prioritise scalability, flexibility & intelligent AI
integration.  This multi-layered approach will provide a seamless experience from script generation to asset creation.

Tech stack:
FrontEnd: 
React for responsive and dynamic user Interface.
Backend: Python based FastAPI microservice for robust and scalable server-side logic
Database: Mongodb for flexibile document management.

AI and ML Components:
Using fine-tuned models from OpenAI or Anthropic,
Another aspect is we can utilise the Intelligent model selection method based on parameters like performance, cost effeciency etc.
Implemementing continious learning for model by using feedback loops for ongoing model improvement.
